# üéÆ Basic Game with SFML and CMake

Welcome to the **Basic Game** project! This is a simple yet versatile game built using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), a powerful multimedia library, and configured with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for easy building and cross-platform compatibility.


This project can be used as a template for C++ projects boosted by the speed and simplicity of the CMake tool.
